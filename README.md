Getting Started with Spring Boot Batch Processing

https://www.section.io/engineering-education/spring-boot-batch-processing/#testing

Spring Batch is a lightweight, open-source framework created to develop scalable batch processing applications. Batch processing is mostly used by applications that process a large quantity of data at a given time. For example, payroll systems use batch processing to send out payments to employees at a given time of the month.

In this tutorial, we will be developing a Spring Boot application that reads data from a CSV file and stores it in an SQL database (H2 database).

Used Technologies :
Jdk 1.8,lombok, spring web, h2 database, spring data jpa, and spring batch
